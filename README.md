tracking attendance for multiple lectures or meetings using these autogenerated sheets would be a tedious task, this bot loops through all attendance sheets, and generate one attendace report for all attendees.

# To use this bot follow these steps:
1- store all attendance sheets in one folder, in this example we're tracking attendance for ModernControl Lectures.

2- within the folder, there must be a sheet with the name Student List, that contains the names of all possible attendees, as shown below:

5- incase of university lectures, the user can specifiy the threshold for attendance minutes, whoever attends less than the threshold will be considered absent.

6- the user can also specifiy maximum absences before disqualification from the course. 

7- then specify when does the lecture start and finish per the given format. 

8- click browse and select the folder that contains the attendance sheets.

9- the full attendance sheet will be auto-generated in that same folder, as shown below:

* the report shows the attendance duration (in minutes) for each student, how many absences and ktab signifies disqualification form the course.
